"""
Tests for Config Flow Schedule Management (Edit/Delete).

This module tests the schedule edit and delete functionality added to the
HeatingControlOptionsFlow. It covers:

1. Helper method for building schedule selector options
2. Edit schedule flow (selection, validation, updating)
3. Delete schedule flow (selection, confirmation, cancellation)
4. Edge cases (empty lists, invalid indices, error handling)

Testing Philosophy:
- Test the happy path (normal user flow)
- Test edge cases (empty lists, invalid data)
- Test error recovery (invalid indices, concurrent modifications)
- Verify logging for debugging/monitoring

Each test is documented with:
- Purpose: What is being tested
- Setup: Initial state and data
- Action: What the test does
- Assertion: Expected outcome
