# Test Documentation: Schedule Management

## Overview

This document explains the comprehensive test suite for the schedule edit/delete functionality in the HeatingControl integration. The tests verify that users can safely and reliably manage heating schedules through the Home Assistant UI.

## Test File

**Location**: `tests/test_config_flow_schedule_management.py`

**Total Tests**: 19 comprehensive tests
**Coverage**: Helper methods, edit flow, delete flow, edge cases, integration tests

---

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Test the Happy Path**: Verify normal user workflows work correctly
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Empty lists, invalid indices, boundary conditions
3. **Test Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of unexpected states
4. **Test Integration**: Verify components work together correctly

### Documentation Standard

Each test includes:
- **Purpose**: What behavior is being tested
- **Setup**: Initial state and data configuration
- **Action**: What the test does
- **Assertions**: Expected outcomes
- **Notes**: Implementation details, UX rationale, edge case explanations

---

## Test Categories

### 1. Helper Method Tests (2 tests)

#### Test: `test_build_schedule_options_with_schedules`

**What It Tests**: The `_build_schedule_options()` helper method correctly formats schedule data for dropdown selectors.

**Why It Matters**: This helper is used by both edit and delete selection steps. Testing it once ensures both flows work correctly and avoids code duplication.

**Implementation Logic**:
```python
# Input: List of schedule dictionaries
schedules = [
    {name: "Morning", start: "07:00", end: "09:00"},
    {name: "Evening", start: "18:00", end: "22:00"},
    ...
]

# Output: Home Assistant selector format
options = [
    {"label": "1. Morning (07:00 - 09:00)", "value": "0"},
    {"label": "2. Evening (18:00 - 22:00)", "value": "1"},
    ...
]
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns correct number of options (3 for 3 schedules)
- ✅ Labels include index number, name, and time window
- ✅ Values are string indices ("0", "1", "2") for selection

**Edge Case**: Empty schedule list → Returns empty list (no crash)

---

### 2. Edit Schedule Flow Tests (5 tests)

#### Architecture Overview

The edit flow consists of 3 steps:

```
User clicks "Edit Schedule"
    ↓
Step 1: select_schedule_to_edit  (Shows list)
    ↓
Step 2: edit_schedule            (Shows form with current values)
    ↓
Step 3: manage_schedules         (Return to menu with updated list)
```

#### Test: `test_select_schedule_to_edit_shows_list`

**What It Tests**: The schedule selection screen displays correctly.

**User Flow**: User is in the manage_schedules menu → Clicks "Edit Schedule" → Sees list of editable schedules

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns form type response
- ✅ Step ID is "select_schedule_to_edit"
- ✅ Form includes schedule_index selector field

**Implementation Note**: The form is built dynamically using `_build_schedule_options()` to populate the dropdown.

---

#### Test: `test_select_schedule_to_edit_with_empty_list`

**What It Tests**: Edge case - attempting to edit when no schedules exist.

**Scenario**: This shouldn't happen in normal use (UI hides "Edit" button), but tests backend safety.

**Error Recovery Logic**:
```python
if not self._schedules:
    # Log warning for debugging
    _LOGGER.warning("Attempted to edit schedule but no schedules available")
    # Gracefully return to menu instead of showing empty dropdown
    return await self.async_step_manage_schedules()
```

**Why This Matters**: Race conditions or concurrent modifications could cause this state. Must handle gracefully without crashing.

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns to manage_schedules (doesn't show empty list)
- ✅ Logs warning for debugging

---

#### Test: `test_edit_schedule_valid_index`

**What It Tests**: Edit form displays with pre-filled current values.

**User Flow**: User selects "Evening" schedule from list → Sees edit form with Evening's current settings

**Pre-fill Logic**:
```python
current_schedule = self._schedules[self._schedule_index]

# Each field uses default= to show current value
vol.Required(CONF_SCHEDULE_NAME,
            default=current_schedule.get(CONF_SCHEDULE_NAME, ""))
vol.Required(CONF_SCHEDULE_TEMPERATURE,
            default=current_schedule.get(CONF_SCHEDULE_TEMPERATURE, 20.0))
# ... etc for all fields
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns edit form
- ✅ Description shows which schedule is being edited
- ✅ Form includes all schedule configuration fields

---

#### Test: `test_edit_schedule_invalid_index_returns_to_menu`

**What It Tests**: Safety validation prevents crashes from bad index values.

**Error Scenarios Covered**:
- Index is None (never set or already reset)
- Index is negative
- Index >= length (out of bounds)
- Index was valid but schedule was deleted concurrently

**Validation Logic**:
```python
if self._schedule_index is None or not (0 <= self._schedule_index < len(self._schedules)):
    _LOGGER.error("Invalid schedule index for edit: %s (total: %d)",
                 self._schedule_index, len(self._schedules))
    self._schedule_index = None  # Reset to clean state
    return await self.async_step_manage_schedules()  # Safe recovery
```

**Why This Matters**: Without validation, accessing `self._schedules[invalid_index]` would raise `IndexError` and crash the config flow.

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns to manage_schedules (no crash)
- ✅ Resets _schedule_index to None
- ✅ Logs error with diagnostic details

---

#### Test: `test_edit_schedule_saves_changes`

**What It Tests**: Modified schedule values are correctly saved.

**Data Flow**:
```
User submits form with changes
    ↓
Build updated schedule_config dict
    ↓
Preserve original schedule ID (important for sensors!)
    ↓
Update self._schedules[index] with new config
    ↓
Reset index to None (clean state)
    ↓
Return to manage_schedules menu
```

**ID Preservation Logic**:
```python
schedule_config = {
    # CRITICAL: Preserve the original ID
    "id": self._schedules[self._schedule_index].get("id", str(uuid.uuid4())),

    # Update all user-configurable fields
    CONF_SCHEDULE_NAME: user_input[CONF_SCHEDULE_NAME],
    CONF_SCHEDULE_TEMPERATURE: user_input.get(CONF_SCHEDULE_TEMPERATURE, 20.0),
    # ... etc
}
```

**Why ID Preservation Matters**:
- Binary sensors use schedule ID: `binary_sensor.heating_schedule_{name}`
- Changing ID would break sensor continuity
- Historical data would be orphaned

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns to manage_schedules
- ✅ Schedule at index 0 has updated values
- ✅ Schedule ID is preserved (same as before edit)
- ✅ _schedule_index reset to None

---

### 3. Delete Schedule Flow Tests (6 tests)

#### Architecture Overview

The delete flow consists of 3 steps with confirmation:

```
User clicks "Delete Schedule"
    ↓
Step 1: select_schedule_to_delete  (Shows list)
    ↓
Step 2: confirm_delete             (Shows confirmation with details)
    ↓
Step 3: manage_schedules           (Return to menu)
```

#### Test: `test_select_schedule_to_delete_shows_list`

**What It Tests**: The delete selection screen displays correctly.

**Verification**: Same structure as edit selection - form with schedule_index selector.

---

#### Test: `test_select_schedule_to_delete_empty_list`

**What It Tests**: Edge case - attempting to delete when no schedules exist.

**Error Recovery**: Same pattern as edit - guards prevent showing empty dropdown, returns to menu with warning.

---

#### Test: `test_confirm_delete_shows_confirmation`

**What It Tests**: Confirmation dialog shows detailed schedule information.

**UX Improvement**: This test verifies the improved delete confirmation UX.

**Old Implementation** (confusing):
```python
# Boolean toggle - users didn't understand this
vol.Required("confirm", default=False): selector.BooleanSelector()
"Set the toggle to ON to confirm deletion, or leave it OFF to cancel."
```

**New Implementation** (intuitive):
```python
# Explicit dropdown with clear labels
vol.Required("action", default="cancel"): selector.SelectSelector(
    options=[
        {"label": "← Cancel - Don't delete", "value": "cancel"},
        {"label": "🗑️ Yes, delete 'Schedule Name'", "value": "confirm"},
    ]
)
```

**Confirmation Details Shown**:
- Schedule name
- Time window (start - end)
- Number of assigned devices
- "This action cannot be undone" warning

**Why This Matters**: Users need full context before making irreversible decisions.

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns confirmation form
- ✅ Description includes schedule name, time, device count
- ✅ Includes "cannot be undone" warning
- ✅ Default option is "cancel" (safe choice)

---

#### Test: `test_confirm_delete_cancellation`

**What It Tests**: Cancelling deletion preserves all schedules.

**User Flow**:
```
User selects "Evening" to delete
    ↓
Sees confirmation: "Delete 'Evening'?"
    ↓
Selects "← Cancel - Don't delete"
    ↓
Returns to menu - Evening still exists
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns to manage_schedules
- ✅ All 3 schedules still present (nothing deleted)
- ✅ Schedule at index 1 is still "Evening"
- ✅ _schedule_index reset to None

---

#### Test: `test_confirm_delete_confirmation`

**What It Tests**: Confirming deletion removes the correct schedule.

**User Flow**:
```
User selects "Evening" (index 1) to delete
    ↓
Confirms: "🗑️ Yes, delete 'Evening'"
    ↓
Schedule removed from list
    ↓
Returns to menu
```

**Deletion Logic**:
```python
if action == "confirm":
    try:
        _LOGGER.info("Deleting schedule: %s", schedule_name)
        del self._schedules[self._schedule_index]  # Remove from list
        self._schedule_index = None
    except IndexError as err:
        # Concurrent modification - schedule already gone
        _LOGGER.error("Error deleting schedule: %s", err)
        self._schedule_index = None
    return await self.async_step_manage_schedules()
```

**Data Verification**:
```
Before: ["Morning", "Evening", "Night"]  # Indices: 0, 1, 2
                       ↓ Delete index 1
After:  ["Morning", "Night"]             # Indices: 0, 1 (Night shifted)
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns to manage_schedules
- ✅ List now has 2 schedules (was 3)
- ✅ Remaining schedules: "Morning" at [0], "Night" at [1]
- ✅ "Evening" is gone
- ✅ _schedule_index reset to None

---

#### Test: `test_confirm_delete_invalid_index`

**What It Tests**: Invalid index during delete confirmation is safely handled.

**Error Scenarios**:
- User selects schedule to delete, but it was deleted concurrently
- Index is None (state corruption)
- Index out of bounds

**Validation Logic** (same as edit):
```python
if self._schedule_index is None or not (0 <= self._schedule_index < len(self._schedules)):
    _LOGGER.error("Invalid schedule index for delete: %s (total: %d)",
                 self._schedule_index, len(self._schedules))
    self._schedule_index = None
    return await self.async_step_manage_schedules()
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns to menu (no crash)
- ✅ No schedules deleted (list unchanged)
- ✅ Logs error with diagnostic info

---

#### Test: `test_delete_last_schedule`

**What It Tests**: Deleting the only remaining schedule works correctly.

**Special Behavior**: The manage_schedules step has reload logic:

```python
async def async_step_manage_schedules(...):
    current_config = self.config_entry.options or self.config_entry.data

    # If _schedules is empty, reload from config
    if not self._schedules:
        self._schedules = list(current_config.get(CONF_SCHEDULES, []))
```

**What This Means**:
- Deleting last schedule → `_schedules` becomes empty `[]`
- Returning to manage_schedules → Reloads from `config_entry.data`
- Config still has 3 schedules until user clicks "Done"
- This is **expected behavior** - changes aren't saved until final save

**Test Focus**: Verify deletion doesn't crash with empty list, not that list stays empty.

**Verification**:
- ✅ Before deletion: 1 schedule
- ✅ Deletion completes without crash
- ✅ Returns to manage_schedules successfully
- ✅ _schedule_index reset to None

---

### 4. Edge Case Tests (3 tests)

#### Test: `test_select_edit_with_invalid_string_index`

**What It Tests**: Type conversion errors are handled gracefully.

**Scenario**: Form data contains `schedule_index: "abc"` instead of valid number.

**Error Handling**:
```python
try:
    self._schedule_index = int(user_input.get("schedule_index"))
    return await self.async_step_edit_schedule()
except (ValueError, TypeError) as err:
    _LOGGER.error("Invalid schedule index selected: %s", err)
    return await self.async_step_manage_schedules()
```

**How This Could Happen**:
- Browser bug sending corrupted data
- Direct API manipulation
- Cosmic ray flipping a bit (seriously, it happens!)

**Verification**:
- ✅ Catches ValueError from `int("abc")`
- ✅ Returns to menu (doesn't crash)
- ✅ Logs error for debugging

---

#### Test: `test_edit_schedule_with_concurrent_deletion`

**What It Tests**: Race condition when schedule is deleted while being edited.

**Real-World Scenario**:
```
Timeline:
T=0: User A opens browser, loads edit dialog for "Night" (index 2)
T=1: User B deletes "Night" via different device
T=2: User A's edit form tries to load → Index 2 no longer exists
```

**Concurrent Modification Simulation**:
```python
# Setup: 3 schedules exist, index 2 is valid
flow._schedules = list(mock_config_entry.data[CONF_SCHEDULES])
flow._schedule_index = 2  # "Night" schedule

# Simulate concurrent deletion - reduce to 2 schedules
flow._schedules = flow._schedules[:2]  # Now only [0, 1] exist

# Try to edit index 2 → Out of bounds!
result = await flow.async_step_edit_schedule(user_input=None)
```

**Protection Logic**:
```python
# Index validation catches this
if not (0 <= self._schedule_index < len(self._schedules)):  # 2 < 2 is False!
    # Safe recovery
    return await self.async_step_manage_schedules()
```

**Why This Matters**: Home Assistant supports multiple concurrent clients (web UI, mobile app, companion devices). Race conditions WILL happen in production.

**Verification**:
- ✅ Detects out-of-bounds condition (2 >= 2)
- ✅ Returns to menu safely
- ✅ Logs diagnostic info (index value, total count)
- ✅ No IndexError crash

---

### 5. Integration Tests (2 tests)

#### Test: `test_manage_schedules_shows_edit_delete_when_schedules_exist`

**What It Tests**: The manage_schedules menu dynamically shows/hides options.

**Dynamic Menu Logic** (config_flow.py:360-366):
```python
# Build action options based on whether schedules exist
action_options = [{"label": "Add Schedule", "value": "add"}]

if self._schedules:  # Only show if schedules exist
    action_options.extend([
        {"label": "Edit Schedule", "value": "edit"},
        {"label": "Delete Schedule", "value": "delete"},
    ])

action_options.append({"label": "Done", "value": "done"})
```

**UX Rationale**: Showing "Edit" and "Delete" buttons when there are no schedules would confuse users. Better to adapt the UI to the current state.

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns form successfully
- ✅ Description shows all 3 schedule names
- ✅ Action selector field exists in schema

**Note**: We can't easily verify the exact options without complex HA selector mocking, but we verify the important parts: correct step, schedules displayed in description.

---

#### Test: `test_manage_schedules_with_no_schedules_in_config`

**What It Tests**: Empty state handling when config has no schedules.

**Setup Challenge**: Need to create config entry with empty schedule list.

**Why This Is Tricky**: manage_schedules reloads from config if `_schedules` is empty:

```python
if not self._schedules:
    self._schedules = list(current_config.get(CONF_SCHEDULES, []))
```

**Solution**: Create dedicated empty config for this test:

```python
empty_config = SimpleNamespace(
    entry_id="test_entry_id",
    data={
        ...
        CONF_SCHEDULES: [],  # Explicitly empty
    }
)
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Returns form successfully
- ✅ Description contains "No schedules configured yet"
- ✅ Action selector exists (will have only Add/Done options)

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

**Add new tests when**:
- Adding new config flow steps
- Changing validation logic
- Adding new error handling
- Modifying data structures

**Update existing tests when**:
- Changing form field names
- Modifying step IDs
- Updating error messages
- Changing default values

### Test Naming Convention

```
test_{step_name}_{scenario}

Examples:
test_edit_schedule_valid_index          # Happy path
test_edit_schedule_invalid_index_...    # Error case
test_confirm_delete_cancellation        # User action
```

---

## Key Implementation Details

### State Management

The OptionsFlow maintains state across steps:

```python
class HeatingControlOptionsFlow:
    def __init__(self, config_entry):
        self._schedules = []           # Current working copy
        self._global_config = {}       # Global settings
        self._available_devices = []   # Device list
        self._schedule_index = None    # Currently selected schedule
```

**Important**: `_schedule_index` must be reset to `None` after operations to prevent stale state.

### Data Flow

```
User starts options flow
    ↓
Load data from config_entry.data
    ↓
User makes changes (edit/delete)
    ↓
Changes stored in self._schedules
    ↓
User clicks "Done" in manage_schedules
    ↓
Save self._schedules to config_entry.options
    ↓
Integration reloads with new config
```

**Key Point**: Changes aren't persisted until user clicks "Done". This allows cancellation and review.

### Index Safety

Always validate indices before array access:

```python
# ✅ SAFE
if self._schedule_index is not None and 0 <= self._schedule_index < len(self._schedules):
    schedule = self._schedules[self._schedule_index]

# ❌ UNSAFE - Could crash!
schedule = self._schedules[self._schedule_index]
```

---

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Tests pass locally but fail in Docker
**Cause**: Different Python or Home Assistant versions
**Fix**: Check `requirements-test.txt` versions

**Issue**: Tests fail after config_flow.py changes
**Cause**: Step IDs or field names changed
**Fix**: Update test assertions to match new names

**Issue**: Assertion on log messages fails
**Cause**: Log level not configured in test
**Fix**: Either configure log level or remove log assertions

**Issue**: Schema string checks fail
**Cause**: HA selector objects don't expose labels in `str()`
**Fix**: Check description_placeholders instead of schema string

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to test coverage:

1. **Mock HA Selector System**: Allow checking exact option labels in forms
2. **Test Coordinator Integration**: Verify `force_update_on_next_refresh()` is called
3. **Test Sensor Updates**: Verify binary sensors update after schedule changes
4. **Performance Tests**: Measure config flow response times
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify screen reader compatibility
